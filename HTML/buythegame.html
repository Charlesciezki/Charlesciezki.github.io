I am a sucker for survival games, but with the oversaturated market it gets tough to find a good one that presents a challenge. The Long Dark, abbreviated herein as "TLD," is one of the exceptional ones. 

Objective
Survival is the name of the game here. You have a backpack with a fairly large capacity, and clothes that won't keep you alive for long. Much like "The Forest," TLD requires you to find sticks, branches and fuel to craft fires and new items. Unlike most survival games, you may see the world as somewhat familiar to you - at least, it was to me. If you have experience with survival/adventure games, you will love this game, and coming from other atmospheric games, TLD is the ideal survival game for me.

Many Challenges
This game is easy. This game is hard. This game is everything in between. Each "region" of the world that you play in has its own difficulty; some have prebuilt shelters for you to keep warm, and others are nothing but desolate wilderness. You can find yourself stranded on a frozen lake, or sipping coffee in the log house. The more you play, the easier you will find the game in general to be, regardless of the difficulty of the region you begin in. For instance, it took two playthrough attempts for me to realize that for some odd reason, the water in toilets is considered potable. Huh. Sleep is key in this game; oversleep and you will burn too many calories, but undersleep and your health will decline. If you are skilled at balancing different aspects of a character, such as hunger v. sickness and agility v. pack size, you will have no trouble with starting on at least a moderately difficult region.

Audio, Graphics, and Performance
This game is, in one word: atmospheric. From the calming to somewhat-creepy background audio to the smoothness of the main character's voice, the audio in this game is absolutely fantastic. I would highly advise you to wear your best set of headphones/earphones when playing this game, as you will notice a difference.
As for the graphics, well, I'm simply amazed at the simplicity yet the spectacular attention to detail in this game. I actually purchased this game solely for the visual quality, and after playing I knew that it was the right choice. Surprisingly, this game is made with UNITY. Yes, you read that right -- Unity. From screenshots, most might say that it looks like a Source 2 engine game. In that regard, I feel like the devs did a great job pushing Unity to its limits to make this game.
One of my personal favorite areas in the game to explore is the forest house by the Coastal Highway and Log Yard area. It's very home-y, and although I was definitely creeped out when I first went upstairs and came across a corpse, it's one of the more calm locations in the region. Outside of shelters, one of the very unique aspects is something that usually goes unnoticed: footprints. I love the fact that your footprints stay in the snow, and maybe it's just me, but I feel that it definitely adds a lot to the game with just one added detail. I have not noticed yet whether the footprints will stay for a certain time duration or if it is based on basically a graphical asset limit, such as 100 or 150.
Speaking of Unity, let's talk about one of its downfalls: performance. I play this game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 860M card, and I do get a steady 60fps. However, at some points textures glitch out and frames drop. My GPU/CPU are not throttling, which leads me to believe it could just be a bug or the result of Unity's poor optimization. It's definitely not the developers' fault. My system does run hot when playing, much hotter than while playing titles such as CS:GO and Saints Row 3/4, but at a similar temperature as when I run Metro 2033/Last Light Redux. If you have at least a 700 series card and proper cooling and ventilation, you'll have no issues.

Value
At this stage of the game's development, I feel that it warrants a price tag of maybe $15 instead of $20. Having played it and seen fairly fast development progress, this IS an early access game that you do want to cash in on because, as many other Early Access games, the price will go up.

Final Points on the Game
TLD is glorious in its appearance, unforgiving in its challenges, and sensory magic at heart. Don't miss out.</h3></div></center>
