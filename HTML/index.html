<center><div><h3 class="test">(First playthrough btw)
Day 2, I was pretty geared up. I had a rifle, and some food, however I had run out of water. I decided to trek out in the morning, as I was quite parched. I came upon a derailed train and spotted a wolf beside it, and I quickly thought to myself, "If I engage this wolf, will my rifle be enough?" He engaged me first, and he ran at me snarling, I fired off a shot and, "oh what a surprise, I missed!" He tackles me into the snowbank, I fight for my life, and eventually I win and throw him away. He began running but I wasn't having any of that. He tore my jacket wide open and sprained my ankle, why would I let him escape? I began chasing him, but he was ready. In retaliation for me chasing him he turned around and began counter-charging. Ofcourse I had my rifle ready this time, yet I barely managed to graze him, he went down! I started cutting him open, good eats tonight! However my conditions are worsening. I'm freezing, my ankles are broken, and I'm still thirsty. I begin running for about 10 seconds until I spot a small overhang. (7% Condition Overall Now) I put the last of my twigs together, and just barely managed to create a fire. I sat by the fire cooking my fish. As I'm about to eat the delightful lake trout, I hear something coming up behind me! I stumble backwards into my fire, and fall to the ground. (2% Condition!) I can barely see now, life is fading away... 
On the other side of the fire, a wolf stares at me. With a last moment memory, I pulled out a flare. "Flares can be used to scare away animals" as said in their descriptions; so I light this sucker up, and with my last breaths I throw it at the wolf. Success, he runs! I feel so achieved but so broken, and I know I have to find shelter. I begin sprinting, (Crawling on the ground fast at this rate.) It's so blurry, I can't see! Where should I go? I follow the tracks, but too my demise, they were the last things I ever saw...

AMAZING GAME, I was genuinely scared by that wolf at the fire, the immersion is unreal.</h3></div></center>

<center><div><h3 class="test">Can't say enough nice things about this game and it's dev team. If You enjoy the combination of inventory management and the feeling of being a lone surviver thrown into a a wintery wilderness, then I'd recommend that You buy this game - it's definetly worth it's asking price.

If I had to point to something negative, I would perhaps say that the game sometimes feel slightly too easy, once You have gotten the hang of the core mechanics. For example, it's not exactly that there are plenty of resources available everywhere, the challenge to get to them has just becomes slightly too easy in the long run (even when playing on the hardest setting).

The game has seen a steady steam of updates since it was first released on Steam. The pace has perhaps somewhat leveled off recently, as the game nears the end of it's alpha stage. Recent updates have been further apart, but large and containing lots of new content and areas to explore.

Thanks for a grate game Hinterland.</h3></div></center>

<center><div><h3 class="test">I'm finally at a point to where I feel like I can leave a fair review for this game. 

I'll start with the day one scenario. You load into a world based on a few different spawn points. The weather will be random upon loading in, so depending on a little RNG - you might find yourself in a very bad situation. However, this is a good thing, this lets you know very quickly what your goals are in this game. You have to stay alive.

The game doesn't hold your hand for the most part, and you have to be able to think on your feet, and make life and death decisions on a daily basis. You're contending with the weather, hunger, thirst, and your overall "health" - which can change based on injury and various other ailments.

The only RNG I have really seen in the game is when it comes to weather, loot placement; which loot does NOT respawn in game, so you must use it wisely/strategically, and things that require a skill - such as lighting a fire, or repairing an object. The more you do a skill based task, the more skill you gain in doing so, much like real life. This is perfect because it means that you won't die simply due to RNG. 

There is plenty of content to see in game, especially with the added maps (for free!). The free maps they added also allow you to transition from one map to the next, you're free to go back and forth as you please. This gives you the ability to setup a base in one map, then move to a whole other map once you feel like you've depleted the resources on your first map. And there is a sense of wanting to keep your survivor alive for as long as possible. Death is permanent, and when it does happen, it's very upsetting - but it also leaves you retracing your steps that led up to it. You learn from your deaths, and you learn what mistakes to not repeat. 

I haven't experienced any game breaking bugs, and only a few minor crashes (2 in nearly 20hrs of play time). I have to recommend this game because it has everything; solid mechanics, good loot, nice graphics, minimal bugs, tons of content, and it's actually a survival game. 

I'm going to end this review with a little comparison if you will. The issue I have with other games in my library is that they market themselves as survival games, when in fact they are open world sandbox games with a couple survival mechanics thrown in. This game isn't about building fancy houses, it's literally about staying alive. You're not going to be crafting guns out of soda cans and a few nuts and bolts laying around. You won't be taming dinosaurs, or fighting cannibals with an Emergency Hatchet. You will be moving from location to location trying to gather enough supplies to keep you alive for another day. 

The balance is very fair, and there is a lot of realism to the game. Yes, it's still just a game at the end of the day, so they had to account for that with some elements of game-play (otherwise no one would survive a week), but for the most part they kept it as realistic as possible. 

If you're looking for a solid survival game, that focuses on actually surving - then I don't think you'll find a better game. If you're tired of "survival" games where you're stuck crafting up a tech tree, constantly building bases, and walking around with no purpose, then this is the game for you.

TL;DR

Solid mechanics.
No RNG deaths.
Several maps that all connect in game. 
True sense of survival. 
Highly recommended if you're looking for a real survival game.</h3></div></center>
