	<h2><b><font color="black">Starting DevCode Camp</font></b></h2>
	<div><p><font color="black"><b>Today 12-14-15 I started my new schooling at DevCode Camp in, Milwaukee, Wi. As my mother dropped me off I found myself rather nervous for the tasks that lay ahead, I quickly realized that I was just excited to leave my old life, and the old me behind. Class starts and we all gather around, to introduce ourselfs and get to know eachother. As the class went around and talked about themselfs I found myself getting even more calm, as I felt like I finally found a safe place to learn and grow. We had a lecture and went about our tasks for the day. As the day came to a close, I could only think of what a wonderful opportunity I had at my doorstep</b></font></p></div>
	<h2><b><font color="black">First Website is coming together.</font></b></h2>
	<div><p><font color="black"><b>Today 12-17-15 was a big break through for me, I put up my first HTML, and it feels great. The knowlege I've gotten through Devcode has helped me create something that is personalized by me, and something I can be proud of. My website features a Home page which contains links to an about me section, a blog, and the start of my portfolio. For now my portfolio only contains my gloving page that I created yesterday. I'm truly on an adventure for knowlege now.</b></font></p></div>
	<div><h2><b><font color="black"><b>First test is complete.</font></b></h2></div>
	<div><font color="black">Today 12-18-15 I took my first test in DevCode Camp, and I did pretty well, if I do say so myself. I prepred by spending the night before adding more onto my portfolio website, which again, is coming along very nicely. I'm excited to see what the next week of learning Javascript will bring me!</b></font></div>
	<div><h2><b><font color="black"><b>Happy Merry Joyous Holidays</b></font></h2></div>
	<div><font color="black">Today 12-29-15 I'd like to take a minute to wish you all a safe and happy holiday! I return to DevCode next week Monday (six days) and I honestly can't wait, I'm excited to learn more about coding and I'm ready to get into Javascript!</b></font></div>
	<div><h2><b><font color="black"><b>Learning Javascript</b></font></h2></div>
	<div><font color="black">Today 01-01-16 we dove into Javascript head-on, I struggled with the whole idea of functions, and I found it very hard to grasp, but once I completed my project, a lot more became clear. I've found that I just need to ask questions and use trial and error to my advantage. I've also learned that I need to make a copy before I start doing trial and error, and I also need to make my GitHub Repo. Eventhough this class is overwhelming at the very least, but I'm excited to see what else I'll be learning in DevCode.</b></font></div>
	<div><h2><b><font color="black">Dice Game Project</font></b></h2></div>
	<div><b><font color="black">Today 01-07-16 we have completed our first Javascript game! We worked on it in a group, the group decided to call the game "Walking Simulator 2016", and that's exactly what it is. The goal of the game is to roll a dice (which we wrote out the code for) and to pass to the next level you need to roll a certain number. I feel that I learned much more because I worked with a group which helped me develop better interpersonal skills. Completing this game has also given me a much better undertanding of the building blocks of code. Recently I've learned something that I will keep with me forever...</font></b></div>
